### Introduction
Forests cover tens of thousands of acres in eastern national parks, are fundamental natural and cultural resources, and provide habitat for countless plants, animals, fungi, and insects (see 'Source Publication' for citations). Park forests protect water quality and soil stability, as well as influence our local weather and reduce some gases that contribute to climate change. However, these critical park resources face a range of threats.
 
The National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring Program (I&M) is tracking forest health across the park system. Monitoring data indicate significant threats to future sustainability of park forests. Many parks lack the minimum level of seedling and sapling density needed to replace canopy trees as they die, or face threats to tree health. This brief for `r paste(park_info$park_full)` (`r paste(park_info$park)`) is part of a larger effort across 39 parks and four I&M networks to assess forest health and aid parks in managing under continuous change. Here, we focus on tree regeneration and potential threat to future forest health - regeneration debt. When forests lack sufficient regeneration, or the species composition in the regeneration layer does not match the canopy, this is regeneration debt.

### Methods
Field Methods & Study Sites - This study analyzed data from 1515 plots in 39 national parks that have similar methods for long-term forest monitoring (Figure 1). Plots were sampled on a 4-year rotating panel, such that one quarter (i.e., one panel) of the plots is sampled every year, and each plot is sampled every 4 years (i.e., one cycle). The data include XX plots from `r paste(park_info$park)`.

Statistical Analysis - We calculated plot-level metrics of forest structure and diversity to assess status and trends in forest health over the past 12 years (i.e., 3 sampling cycles with cycle 1 covering survey years 2008 - 2011, cycle 2 covering 2012 - 2015, and cycle 3 covering 2016 - 2019). We fit linear mixed effects models and case bootstrapping to generate model coefficients and confidence intervals (see Source Publication for analysis details).

### Results
`r paste(park_info$park_full)` (`r paste(park_info$park)`) is located in the `r ifelse(park_info$Network == "NETN", paste("Northeast Temperate"), ifelse(park_info$Network == "NCRN", paste("National Capital Region"), ifelse(park_info$Network == "NCBN", paste("Northeast Coastal and Barrier"), ifelse(park_info$Network == "MIDN", paste("Mid-Atlantic"), paste("Eastern Rivers and Mountains")))))` `r paste0( '(', park_info$Network, ')')` Inventory and Monitoring Network (Figure 1). `r paste(park_info$park)`'s regeneration status is categorized as `r paste(park_data$park_reggrp)`. Figures 2 & 3 present trends of tree, sapling, and seedling measures. Figure 4 shows the stocking index for `r paste(park_info$park)`, and Figure 5 represents trends in tree basal area and density. To see the distribution of trees by diameter classes, see Figure 6. Finally, a full summary of regeneration status, native canopy trends, native subcanopy trends, and exotic trends for 13 metrics can be seen in Table 1.

### Discussion
These findings underscore the critical importance of an integrated forest management approach that promotes an abundant and diverse regeneration layer. In most cases, this can only be achieved through long-term (i.e. multi-decadal) management of white-tailed deer and invasive plants. Small-scale disturbances that increase structural complexity may also promote regeneration where stress from deer and invasive plants is minimal. Without management intervention, forest loss may become a widespread pattern in eastern national parks and the broader region.

<!-- **Sapling Density**: Densities < 0.1 stems/sq.m are classified as critical; densities between 0.1 – 0.16 stems/sq.m are classified as caution (Niewinski et al., 2006); densities greater than or equal to 0.16 stems/sq.m are classified as acceptable.\ -->
<!-- **Seedling Density**: Densities < 0.25 stems/sq.m are classified as critical; densities between 0.25 – 1.99 stems/sq.m are classified as Caution; densities greater than or equal to 2 stems/sq.m are classified as acceptable.\ -->
<!-- **Stocked Plots**: Proportions < 33% are classified as critical; proportions between 33% – 66% are classified as caution; proportions greater than or equal to 67% stems/sq.m is classified as acceptable. Note that stocking thresholds are adjusted based on average deer browse index, such that parks that average 3 or higher for deer browse index must have a stocking index of 100 to be considered stocked. Parks that average < 3 for deer browse index only require a stocking index of 50 to be stocked.\ -->
<!-- **Stocking Index**: Average stocking < 25 is classified as critical; average stocking between 25 – 100 is classified as caution; average stocking greater than or equal to 100 is classified as acceptable (McWilliams et al., 2015). Note that the stocking index only includes native canopy-forming species, and does not include ash species (*Fraxinus* spp.).\ -->
<!-- **Deer Browse Impacts**: Average DBI greater than or equal to 4 is classified as critical; average DBI between 3.01 – 3.99 is classified as caution; average DBI less than or equal to 3 is classified as acceptable (McWilliams et al., 2015).\ -->
<!-- **Flat Tree Diameter Distribution**: Only critical and acceptable levels were defined for this metric. Critical was determined using Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) to determine whether a log-linear or linear model better predicted the tree diameter distribution by size class for a given park. If AIC determines a linear fit to be the best model, this indicates there are fewer trees than expected in lower size classes, and is suggestive of prolonged recruitment failure. Therefore, parks that are best fit by a linear model are classified as critical. Parks best fit by log-linear model are classified as acceptable.\ -->
<!-- **Sapling Composition**: Less than 50% native canopy species by density is classified as critical; 50 - 70% native canopy species by density is classified as caution; greater than or equal to 70% native canopy species by density is classified as acceptable (Marquis, 1994; Leak et al., 2014).\ -->
<!-- **Seedling Composition**: Less than 50% native canopy species by density is classified as critical; 50 - 70% native canopy species by density is classified as caution; greater than or equal to 70% native canopy species by density is classified as acceptable (Marquis, 1994; Leak et al., 2014).\ -->
<!-- **Sorensen**: Sorensen similarity is presence-only based similarity that ranges from 0 to 1, and includes all species observed in each strata. Only 2 thresholds were defined for this metric. Similarity < 0.2 is classified as critical, and similarity greater than or equal to 0.2 is classified as acceptable. -->

<!-- Trend metrics are grouped by species type, with Native Canopy only including native, canopy forming species; Native Subcan. including native species that are typically understory trees; and Exotic including non-native tree species. Note that ash species (*Fraxinus* spp.) are not considered native canopy-forming species due to impacts from Emerald Ash Borer. Trends were assessed using non-parametric bootstrapping and random intercept linear models. Only metrics with > 6 plots and with > 10% non-zero values were modeled. -->
