# `r paste(park_info$park_full)`'s Forests Regeneration Status is `r paste(park_data$park_reggrp)`

**Introduction** \hfill\break
`r paste(park_info$park_full)`'s (`r paste(park_info$park)`) forest regeneration status of `r paste("'", park_data$park_reggrp, "'", sep = "")` means that the park `r ifelse(park_data$park_reggrp == "Imminent Failure", paste("is experiencing severe regeneration failure and is at risk of forest loss. In some cases, this forest loss may already underway"), ifelse(park_data$park_reggrp == "Probable Failure", paste("is experiencing regeneration failure as indicated by lacking and/or declining sapling density, although seedlings are more abundant than in the 'Imminent Failure' category"), ifelse(park_data$park_reggrp == "Insecure", paste("lacks sapling density, but has sufficient and often increasing seedling layers, and overall lower deer browse impacts. Significant trends in the 'Insecure' category tend to be due to forest dynamics (i.e., succession)"), paste("has abundant seedling and sapling layers and show few concerning trends"))))`.

**Main Findings** \hfill\break
`r paste(park_info$park_full)` (`r paste(park_info$park)`) is located in the `r ifelse(park_info$Network == "NETN", paste("Northeast Temperate"), ifelse(park_info$Network == "NCRN", paste("National Capital Region"), ifelse(park_info$Network == "NCBN", paste("Northeast Coastal and Barrier"), ifelse(park_info$Network == "MIDN", paste("Mid-Atlantic"), paste("Eastern Rivers and Mountains")))))` `r paste0( '(', park_info$Network, ')')` Inventory and Monitoring Network (Figure 1). `r paste(park_info$park)`'s regeneration status is categorized as `r paste(park_data$park_reggrp)`. Figures 2 & 3 present trends of tree, sapling, and seedling measures. Figure 4 shows the stocking index for `r paste(park_info$park)`, and Figure 5 represents trends in tree basal area and density. To see the distribution of trees by diameter classes, see Figure 6. Finally, a full summary of regeneration status, native canopy trends, native sub-canopy trends, and exotic trends for 13 metrics can be seen in Table 1.

**Management Suggestions** \hfill\break
These findings underscore the critical importance of an integrated forest management approach that promotes an abundant and diverse regeneration layer. In most cases, this can only be achieved through long-term (i.e. multi-decadal) management of white-tailed deer and invasive plants. Small-scale disturbances that increase structural complexity may also promote regeneration where stress from deer and invasive plants is minimal. Without management intervention, forest loss may become a widespread pattern in eastern national parks and the broader region.

<!-- **Sapling Density**: Densities < 0.1 stems/sq.m are classified as critical; densities between 0.1 – 0.16 stems/sq.m are classified as caution (Niewinski et al., 2006); densities greater than or equal to 0.16 stems/sq.m are classified as acceptable.\ -->
<!-- **Seedling Density**: Densities < 0.25 stems/sq.m are classified as critical; densities between 0.25 – 1.99 stems/sq.m are classified as Caution; densities greater than or equal to 2 stems/sq.m are classified as acceptable.\ -->
<!-- **Stocked Plots**: Proportions < 33% are classified as critical; proportions between 33% – 66% are classified as caution; proportions greater than or equal to 67% stems/sq.m is classified as acceptable. Note that stocking thresholds are adjusted based on average deer browse index, such that parks that average 3 or higher for deer browse index must have a stocking index of 100 to be considered stocked. Parks that average < 3 for deer browse index only require a stocking index of 50 to be stocked.\ -->
<!-- **Stocking Index**: Average stocking < 25 is classified as critical; average stocking between 25 – 100 is classified as caution; average stocking greater than or equal to 100 is classified as acceptable (McWilliams et al., 2015). Note that the stocking index only includes native canopy-forming species, and does not include ash species (*Fraxinus* spp.).\ -->
<!-- **Deer Browse Impacts**: Average DBI greater than or equal to 4 is classified as critical; average DBI between 3.01 – 3.99 is classified as caution; average DBI less than or equal to 3 is classified as acceptable (McWilliams et al., 2015).\ -->
<!-- **Flat Tree Diameter Distribution**: Only critical and acceptable levels were defined for this metric. Critical was determined using Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) to determine whether a log-linear or linear model better predicted the tree diameter distribution by size class for a given park. If AIC determines a linear fit to be the best model, this indicates there are fewer trees than expected in lower size classes, and is suggestive of prolonged recruitment failure. Therefore, parks that are best fit by a linear model are classified as critical. Parks best fit by log-linear model are classified as acceptable.\ -->
<!-- **Sapling Composition**: Less than 50% native canopy species by density is classified as critical; 50 - 70% native canopy species by density is classified as caution; greater than or equal to 70% native canopy species by density is classified as acceptable (Marquis, 1994; Leak et al., 2014).\ -->
<!-- **Seedling Composition**: Less than 50% native canopy species by density is classified as critical; 50 - 70% native canopy species by density is classified as caution; greater than or equal to 70% native canopy species by density is classified as acceptable (Marquis, 1994; Leak et al., 2014).\ -->
<!-- **Sorensen**: Sorensen similarity is presence-only based similarity that ranges from 0 to 1, and includes all species observed in each strata. Only 2 thresholds were defined for this metric. Similarity < 0.2 is classified as critical, and similarity greater than or equal to 0.2 is classified as acceptable. -->

<!-- Trend metrics are grouped by species type, with Native Canopy only including native, canopy forming species; Native Subcan. including native species that are typically understory trees; and Exotic including non-native tree species. Note that ash species (*Fraxinus* spp.) are not considered native canopy-forming species due to impacts from Emerald Ash Borer. Trends were assessed using non-parametric bootstrapping and random intercept linear models. Only metrics with > 6 plots and with > 10% non-zero values were modeled. -->
