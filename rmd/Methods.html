<h3>Field Methods & Study Sites</h3>

<p>This study analyzed data from 1515 plots in 39 national parks that have similar methods for long-term forest monitoring (Figure 1). In each park, monitoring plot locations were determined using Generalized Random-Tessellation Stratification (GRTS) to generate a spatially balanced and randomized sample of plot locations across the park's forested area (Stevens and Olsen 2004). Plots were sampled on a 4-year rotating panel, such that one quarter (i.e., one panel) of the plots is sampled every year, and each plot is sampled every 4 years (i.e., one cycle).</p>

<h3>Statistical Analysis</h3>

<p>We calculated plot-level metrics of forest structure and diversity to assess status and trends in forest health, with species ephasis on regeneration. To estimate trends over time, we used cycle as a numeric independent variable in our models, with cycle 1 covering survey years 2008 - 2011, cycle 2 covering survey years 2012 - 2015, and cycle 3 covering survey years 2016 - 2019. We fit linear mixed effects models, with plot as a random intercept, to estimate trends in forest metrics using the lme4 package (Bates et al. 2015). Diagnostics (e.g., residual plots) on these models consistently indicated issues with normality and constant variance. While estimates of coefficients (e.g., slope) are robust to violations of non-normal error, traditional significance testing is not (Maas and Hox 2004, Givens and Hoeting 2012). We therefore used case bootstrapping, a nonparametric bootstrap method, to generate empirical 95% confidence intervals of model coefficients based on 1000 samples for each model. Case bootstrapping works by randomly sampling plots (i.e., cases) along with the survey data from those plots in the order they were sampled to generate a sampling distribution that maintains the underlying random structure of the dataset (Givens and Hoeting 2012). While case bootstrapping relaxes the assumptions of the underlying error distribution, it also requires a sufficient number of plots to sample because the sampling distribution is derived entirely from resampling the existing data. We therefore were unable to assess Sagamore Hill NHS (SAHI) and Wolf Trap Park for the Performing Arts (WOTR) for trends because they had too few plots (i.e., < 6 plots) to create a usable sampling distribution. </p>
