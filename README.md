# Forest Regeneration Briefs for all 39 Eastern National Parks
Forked from NCRN/RFI_regen_trends to build park-specific briefs. The integral components to creating these briefs are located within the "breifs" directory. Here a PDF RMarkdown document exists that specifies the park parameters. Elements needed to create these breifs are located in the "data", "outputs", and "briefs/inputs" directories. To create the briefs, run the "run_briefs.R" script located in the "briefs/scripts" directory, which depends upon the "run_briefs_function.R" script. The created briefs are written to the "briefs/outputs" directory.
